    <p class="p3">Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.</p>
    <h3><b>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:<b></h3>>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1914</b> -  Born in Cresco, Iowa </li>>
         
        <li><b>1933</b>> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br>
             to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        <li><b>1935 </b>- Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> 
            Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>
            them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
        <li>1<b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
        <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br>
             cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br>
              Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>>
        <li><b>1941 </b>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>
            rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> 
            to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
        
    </ul>
        <p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution<br> 
            that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to <br>
            human peace and progress."
             <br>
